    "#1. Started with a small API of just the Pacific North West\n",
    "#2. Had to expand our scope to the OBIS Seamap from Duke University that compiled logs from whale sightings across multiple datasets\n",
    "#3. Selected sea mammals to refine our search\n",
    "#4. Dropped columns that were not pertinent to our research (‘oid', 'datasets', 'geom_wkt', 'csquare’)\n",
    "#       4a. These columns identified dataset information that we did not require for our analysis\n",
    "#5. Dropped NaN values, so our data may be slightly misrepresented, but with how large the dataset is, we decided it was worth the risk\n",
    "#6. We refined our dataframe to only include sightings of one species vs. sightings of multiple species to get separate data to answer different questions\n",
    "#7. Because of the amount of data and sightings over time, we used a logrithmic scale for the y-axis to better display the data\n",
    "#8. We included the normal y-axis graph to show the difference in whale sightings over-time (The sudden increase in whale sightings could be due to conservation efforts and/or the use of technology to submit whale sightings progressed over time)"
